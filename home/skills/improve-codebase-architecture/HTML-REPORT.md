# HTML Report Format

One self-contained HTML file in the OS temp directory. Tailwind and Mermaid come from CDNs. Mermaid for graph-shaped diagrams; hand-built divs and inline SVG for mass diagrams and cross-sections. Mix the two.

## Scaffold

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Architecture review for {{repo name}}</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <script type="module">
      import mermaid from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs";
      mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true, theme: "neutral", securityLevel: "loose" });
    </script>
    <style>
      /* small custom layer for things Tailwind doesn't cover cleanly:
         dashed seam lines, hand-drawn-feeling arrow heads, etc. */
      .seam { stroke-dasharray: 4 4; }
      .leak { stroke: #dc2626; }
      .deep { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #0f172a, #1e293b); }
    </style>

## Header

Repo name, date, and a compact legend: solid box = module, dashed line = seam, red arrow = leakage, thick dark box = deep module. No introduction. Straight into the candidates.

## Candidate card

The diagrams carry the weight. Prose is sparse and uses the glossary terms from SKILL.md.

Each candidate is one `<article>`:

- **Title**: names the deepening, e.g. "Collapse the Order intake pipeline".
- **Badge row**: recommendation strength (`Strong` = emerald, `Worth exploring` = amber, `Speculative` = slate), plus a tag for how the module's dependencies are handled at the seam (`in-process`, `local-substitutable`, `ports & adapters`, `mock`).
- **Files**: monospaced list, `font-mono text-sm`.
- **Before / After diagram**: two columns, side by side. Patterns below.
- **Problem**: one sentence. What hurts.
- **Solution**: one sentence. What changes.
- **Wins**: bullets, ≤6 words each. e.g. "Tests hit one interface", "Pricing logic stops leaking", "Delete 4 shallow wrappers".
- **ADR callout** (if applicable): one line in an amber-tinted box.

No paragraphs. If the diagram needs one, redraw the diagram.

## Diagram patterns

Pick the pattern that fits the candidate. Vary them.

### Mermaid graph (the workhorse for dependencies / call flow)

A Mermaid `flowchart` or `graph` when the point is "X calls Y calls Z." Wrap it in a Tailwind card. Use classDef to colour leakage edges red and the deep module dark. Sequence diagrams suit "before: 6 round-trips; after: 1."

```html
<div class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 bg-white p-4">
  <pre class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR
      A[OrderHandler] --> B[OrderValidator]
      B --> C[OrderRepo]
      C -.leak.-> D[PricingClient]
      classDef leak stroke:#dc2626,stroke-width:2px;
      class C,D leak
  </pre>
</div>
```

### Hand-built boxes-and-arrows (when Mermaid's layout fights you)

Modules as bordered, labelled `<div>`s. Arrows as inline SVG `<line>` or `<path>` positioned absolutely over a relative container. Use this when the "after" diagram is one thick-bordered deep module with greyed-out internals; Mermaid cannot render that weight.

### Cross-section (good for layered shallowness)

Stack horizontal bands (`h-12 border-l-4`) to show layers a call passes through. Before: 6 thin layers each doing nothing. After: 1 thick band labelled with the consolidated responsibility.

### Mass diagram (good for "interface as wide as implementation")

Two rectangles per module: one for interface surface area, one for implementation. Before: interface rectangle is nearly as tall as the implementation rectangle (shallow). After: interface rectangle is short, implementation rectangle is tall (deep).

### Call-graph collapse

Before: a tree of function calls rendered as nested boxes. After: the same tree collapsed into one box, with the now-internal calls shown faded inside it.

## Style guidance

- Editorial, not dashboard. Generous whitespace. `font-serif` headings optional.
- Colour sparingly: one accent (emerald or indigo) plus red for leakage and amber for warnings.
- Keep diagrams ~320px tall so before/after sits comfortably side by side without scrolling.
- `text-xs uppercase tracking-wider` for module labels inside diagrams.
- The only scripts are the Tailwind CDN and the Mermaid ESM import. No other interactivity.

## Top recommendation section

One larger card: candidate name, one sentence on why, anchor link to its card.

## Tone

Plain English. Architectural nouns and verbs come from the Vocabulary section of [SKILL.md](SKILL.md).

**Use exactly:** module, interface, implementation, depth, deep, shallow, seam, adapter, leverage, locality.

**Never substitute:** component, service, unit (for module) · API, signature (for interface) · boundary (for seam) · layer, wrapper (for module, when you mean module).

**Phrasings that fit the style:**

- "Order intake module is shallow: interface nearly matches the implementation."
- "Pricing leaks across the seam."
- "Deepen: one interface, one place to test."
- "Two adapters justify the seam: HTTP in prod, in-memory in tests."

**Wins bullets** name the gain in glossary terms: *"locality: bugs concentrate in one module"*, *"leverage: one interface, N call sites"*, *"interface shrinks; implementation absorbs the wrappers"*. Not *"easier to maintain"* or *"cleaner code"*.

No hedging, no "it's worth noting that…". If a sentence could be a bullet, make it a bullet. If a bullet could be cut, cut it. Prefer a glossary term to a new one.
